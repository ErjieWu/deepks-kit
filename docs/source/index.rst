DeePKS-kit Documentation
===================================



DeePKS-kit is a program to generate accurate energy functionals for quantum chemistry systems (in connection with `PySCF <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf>`_) 
and periodic systems (in connection with `ABACUS <https://github.com/deepmodeling/abacus-develop>`_), for both perturbative scheme (`DeePHF <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.0c03886>`_) and self-consistent scheme (`DeePKS <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00872>`_).

This documentation will currently focus on running DeePKS-kit for periodic systems, i.e., in connection with ABACUS. 
For molecular systems, we refer the users to DeePKS-kit documentation on GitHub.
