DeePKS-kit Documentation
===================================

DeePKS-kit is a program to generate accurate energy functionals for quantum chemistry systems (in connection with PySCF) 
and periodic systems (in connection with ABACUS), for both perturbative scheme (DeePHF) and self-consistent scheme (DeePKS).

This documentation will currently focus on running DeePKS-kit for periodic systems, i.e., in connection with ABACUS. 
For molecular systems, we refer the users to DeePKS-kit documentation on GitHub. 

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
